                        <p class = "content__paragraph">The Bees Knees is a pop rock band originating
                            from San Francisco, California. The band
                            consists a dynamic lineup featuring two lead
                            vocalists, two guitarists, a bassist, a
                            keyboardist and a drummer. The band achieved
                            its first commercial success as an unsigned act,
                            drawing attention from their future manager.
                            Having extensive experience working with
                            both new and seasoned acts, the manager was
                            confident the band could succeed even further
                            with more support, pushing The Bees Knees to
                            sign with a well known record label.
                        </p>
                        <p class ="content__paragraph">
                            From there, the band has soared, gaining
                            international recognition and ranking in the top
                            10 on the Poster Charts. New fans immediately
                            fell in love with the band's original and organic
                            attitude, solidifying their place as one of the
                            hottest and fastest up and coming acts of this
                            century. Fans affectionately refer to themselves
                            as “The Hive” and are drawn to their candid
                            and authentic performances on stage. The
                            Bees Knees are currently recording their
                            second studio album, looking to be released in
                            early 2024.
