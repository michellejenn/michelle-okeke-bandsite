                <h3>The Bees Knees</h3>
                <article>
                <p>The Bees Knees is a pop rock band originating
                    from San Francisco, California. The band
                    consists a dynamic lineup featuring two lead
                    vocalists, two guitarists, a bassist, a
                    keyboardist and a drummer. The band achieved
                    its first commercial success as an unsigned act,
                    drawing attention from their future manager.
                    Having extensive experience working with
                    both new and seasoned acts, the manager was
                    confident the band could succeed even further
                    with more support, pushing The Bees Knees to
                    sign with a well known record label.</p>

                    From there, the band has soared, gaining
                    international recognition and ranking in the top
                    10 on the Poster Charts. New fans immediately
                    fell in love with the band's original and organic
                    attitude, solidifying their place as one of the
                    hottest and fastest up and coming acts of this
                    century. Fans affectionately refer to themselves
                    as “The Hive” and are drawn to their candid
                    and authentic performances on stage. The
                    Bees Knees are currently recording their
                    second studio album, looking to be released in
                    early 2024.
